            "The computer is the data-based electronic machine initially invented by Charles Babbage back in 1837. H e is called the “Father of computer”. With the computer’s discovery, man has entered a new period of impr ovement. In this modern era, lives would be impossible without owning a computer. A computer provides us with a wide range of possibilities, and there is an infinite number of things that can be done with the hel p of a computer. A computer is a widely used device. Almost every family has a computer. It can perform various functions and make our lives easier. It has four main parts: Monitor, Keyboard, CPU, and Mouse. A Computer can be used to send and receive messages and emails. It also has features like the paint tool, notepad, and c alculator. It allows us to store and modify data. A computer is a very reliable device and is used everywhe re, starting from schools to offices to medical fields. The only disadvantage of a computer is that we depe nd too much on it and use it to complete even the easiest of tasks. Even if that is the case, there is nothin g that a computer cannot do for us. Scientists are working every day to improve the quality of computers. Having basic knowledge about computers is important in this generation so that work can be done easily. There is no place on this planet where a computer is not used. Computers are an essential part of our live s. Whether it is school, college, or office work, most of it is completed with a computer’s help. It has four e ssential parts: Monitor, Keyboard, CPU, and Mouse. They are the hardware of any computer system. The monitor is like the T.V screen, which displays the input data. The keyboard is the part that is used to type sentences or write numbers on the monitor. The mouse is used to click icons on the monitor, and the CP U is the brain of the computer. A computer makes our lives ten times easier. It has features like the paint tool which can be used to draw and paint on the monitor—Word, which can be used to take notes. Music players and Windows Media Pla yer can be used to play music and watch movies and videos. A computer can also be connected to the int ernet, enabling the user to watch movies and videos online. A computer is used to send and receive email s and store and alter data. It makes complex calculations easier. Computers are used widely in industries, government institutions, banks, insurance companies, schools, offices, medical fields, and of course, in every home. However, using a computer comes with a few disadv antages. Hackers can hack and steal private information through viruses any time they like. Using a comp uter makes us lazy since we rely too much on it and stop working hard. Even with problems, no doubt livin g our lives would be impossible without a computer by our side. Researchers are working day and night to increase the quality of computers. Knowing operating a computer is a must in this generation. If we do no t have that, we will fall behind in the daily race of life. \n",
